# 3. Deploying Applications

NB! All of the examples here will assume a Rocky 9 OS. If you do decide to choose another OS, replace with the equivalent commands as required.

## 3.2 JupyterLab

- Decide which instance you would like to setup this application within.
- Ensure that `pip` is available.
- Install `virtualenv` via `pip`.
- Create a new Python virtual environment, and install the `jupyterlab` module.
- To run the service behind a screen session:
  ```bash
  $ sudo dnf install epel-release
  $ sudo dnf install screen
  $ screen -S session_name
  ```
- Activate the Python virtual environment containing `jupyterlab`.
- Start a new JupyterLab server:
  ```bash
  jupyter lab --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8.8.8.8
  ```
- `ctrl-D` to detach from screen session.

**Challenges**:
- Can you figure out two different ways to access this JupyterLab server via your local browser?

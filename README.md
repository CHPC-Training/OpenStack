# OpenStack hands-on tutorial

This is a hands-on tutorial for creating and managing resources within an OpenStack Cloud environment. In it we cover:
- How to access your (pre-created) OpenStack project space.
- Creating and managing resources via the Horizon Dashboard.
- Deploying and accessing example applications/services running within OpenStack.
- Creating and managing resources via Terraform and GitLab.

The idea is approach this in numerical order of the directory structure, but to get somewhat more out of this, the following order is recommended:
- Sections 0, 1, 2, and 3.1.
- Section 4 and then back to 3.2.

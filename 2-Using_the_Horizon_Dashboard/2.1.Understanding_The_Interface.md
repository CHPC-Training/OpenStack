  <img width="33%" alt="create_subnet" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0eb71eac-fb40-4081-81bc-de2b6630b1d3" />

</p>

#### Private Router
To create a private router, navigate to the "Network" --> "Routers" section on the left menu, click on "+ Create Router" on the top right.
<p float="left">

</p>
Next, navigate to the "Network" --> "Network Topology" section on the left menu, hover the cursor over box for the router just created, and then click on "+ Add Interface".

</p>
Now, any virtual machines added to this private network would be able to reach the public internet.

#### SSH Security Group

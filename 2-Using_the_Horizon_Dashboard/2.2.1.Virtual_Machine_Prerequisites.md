## Virtual Machine Prerequisites

Before creating our first virtual machine (VM) instance, we need to ensure there are other resources in place to allow us to ultimately access the VM. Any guesses what these could be?

### Private Network
To create a private network, navigate to the "Network" --> "Networks" section on the left menu, click on "+ Create Network" on the top right.

  <img width="33%" alt="create_subnet" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0eb71eac-fb40-4081-81bc-de2b6630b1d3" />

</p>

### Private Router
To create a private router, navigate to the "Network" --> "Routers" section on the left menu, click on "+ Create Router" on the top right.
<p float="left">
  <img width="33%" alt="create_router" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ec488e4-b7d7-4bee-86e9-c53bc24d4839" />
</p>
Next, navigate to the "Network" --> "Network Topology" section on the left menu, hover the cursor over box for the router just created, and then click on "+ Add Interface".
<p float="left">
  <img width="49%" alt="hover_router" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5546bec9-2f20-494f-807f-3962490c7935" />
  <img width="49%" alt="add_interface" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d9440a6-b914-41b0-9923-f5cd46f91c9d" />
</p>
Now, any virtual machines added to this private network would be able to reach the public internet.

### SSH Security Group
Navigate to the "Network" --> "Security Groups" section on the left menu, click on "+ Create Security Group" on the top right.
<p float="left">
  <img width="49%" alt="create_ssh_secgroup" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e40e16cf-e101-4839-8c4a-9d99f3bbf357" />
  <img width="49%" alt="add_ssh_rule" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/812693a6-57f9-4860-9bcf-25addb46a722" />
</p>

After adding the appropriate rule for allowing SSH access, we are nearly ready to create our first VM.

### SSH Key Pair
Navigate to the "Compute" --> "Key Pairs" section on the left menu, and either click on "+ Create Key Pair" or "Import Public Key" the top right -- we will inject this into the VM instances we create.
